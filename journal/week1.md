# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

This week was quite eventful for me, I learnt a whole lot from the live sessions. These helped me with a deeper understanding on how docker works.

I was able to complete all the required tasks for this week. 

### Challenges

I came accross a bug that really got on my nerves, when working on the notifications page on my frontend application, it was a  typo in my NotificationsFeedPage.js, 

This was a miss-spelt NotificationsFeedPage.css and this caused the index file to point to a null css. the inspect tool on google chrome and the "Before you ask for help" video were helpful in resolving this.
